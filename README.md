# Rust Book WebServer Excercise

This is a guessing gae excercise from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
which I went through and played with that code alongside reading through the book. It
contains an implementation of a number guessing game in Rust, mainly following what the
book provided, though it may be slighly modified to satisfy my learning curiosity and
trying the extra possibilities of the language.

This is mostly intended to be a self-reference, but if anyone finds it interesting you
may freely use it for your own reference.


## The Game

We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works:
the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player
to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too
low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
